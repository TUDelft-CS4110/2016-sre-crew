## Introduction

Usage of softwares is increasing every year along with evolving technology.
Software is made for multiple different purposes and require distinctive resources and security measures.
What is common to most software is that it is supposed to work correctly and not have bugs or security breaches.
To ensure correctness, software has to be tested extensively.
With software getting more complex, the more difficult it is to test it.
Alongside the constant evolution of software, new automated testing methods have also been introduced.
In this paper we discuss two state-of-the-art techniques for testing the correctness of software: Fuzzing and State Machine Learning, and apply these techniques on Android applications using a modern testing tool.

The reason why we analyze these two methods is because of a tool that was made less than a year ago at Delft University of Technology.
This tool was developed as a Bachelor project for the IT bank company [bunq](https://www.bunq.com) to test their iOS and Android applications.
The tool is split in two parts, [fuzzer](https://github.com/bunqcom/fuzzer) for fuzzing and [fsm-learner](https://github.com/bunqcom/fsm-learner) for learning finite state machines.
The tool was made specifically for the bunq applications but with some configuration changes it is possible to apply it on any other application.

In this paper we will analyze the fuzzer and fsm-learner tools and apply them on two very different applications.
The progress of using the tool will be described, the results from using it along with alternations to the tool and possible future work.
